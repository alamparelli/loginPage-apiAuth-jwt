# Login Page & API Authentication with JWT

This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates a secure login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. It consists of a React frontend and an Express.js backend, showcasing best practices in modern web development.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Frontend (React)
2. Backend (Express.js)

### Frontend

The frontend is a React application that provides a user interface for login and user management. Key features include:

- React Router for navigation
- Context API for state management
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Protected routes for authenticated users

### Backend

The backend is an Express.js server that handles authentication and user management. Key features include:

- RESTful API design
- JWT-based authentication
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Helmet for enhanced security headers
- Cookie-based token storage

## Key Technologies and Concepts

This project demonstrates proficiency in several important web development concepts:

1. **JWT Authentication**: Implementing secure, token-based authentication for stateless client-server communication.

2. **React Hooks and Context API**: Utilizing modern React patterns for state management and component logic.

3. **Express.js Middleware**: Implementing custom middleware for request processing, error handling, and authentication.

4. **API Security**: Implementing best practices such as CORS and Helmet to protect the API.

5. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Demonstrating how to properly integrate a React frontend with an Express.js backend.

6. **Routing**: Implementing client-side routing in React and server-side routing in Express.js.

7. **Environment Configuration**: Using environment variables for configuration management.

8. **Error Handling**: Implementing proper error handling on both frontend and backend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (refer to .env.example in the backend folder)
4. Start the backend server:

   ```
   cd backend && npm start
   ```

5. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Implement user registration functionality
- Add more robust error handling and validation
- Integrate with a production-ready database
- Implement refresh token mechanism for enhanced security
- Add unit and integration tests

This project serves as a solid foundation for building secure, full-stack web applications using modern JavaScript technologies.
